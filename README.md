Minesweeper

Welcome to the Minesweeper project! This is a classic Minesweeper game implemented in Java, with JavaFX used for the frontend.
The goal of the game is to clear a rectangular board containing hidden "mines" without detonating any of them. 
The game provides a simple yet challenging experience, perfect for both casual and strategic players.

Features

    - Classic Minesweeper gameplay: Clear the board without hitting any mines.

    - Multiple difficulty levels: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard modes, each with a predefined board size and number of mines.

    - Intuitive controls: Easy-to-use interface for flagging and revealing cells.

    - Win/Lose conditions: Win by revealing all safe cells or lose by clicking on a mine.

    - Timer and mine counter: Track your progress with a built-in timer and mine counter.

How to Play

    1. Reveal a cell: Left-click on a cell to reveal it. If it's a mine, the game ends. If it's safe, a number will appear indicating how many mines are adjacent to that cell.

    2. Flag a mine: Right-click on a cell to flag it as a potential mine. This helps you keep track of suspected mines.

    3. Win the game: Reveal all non-mine cells to win the game.
